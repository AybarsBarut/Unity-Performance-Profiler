# Unity Runtime Profiler Monitor

This is a lightweight in-game profiler display for Unity that shows real-time performance data using Unity's built-in UnityEngine.Profiler API.

## Features

- Real-time FPS display
- Memory usage (allocated, reserved, Mono heap)

- Draw calls and rendered objects count
- Simple overlay UI (left-top corner of screen)
- Works in both 3D and VR projects

## Installation

1. Add an empty GameObject to your scene.
2. Rename it to Profiler (optional but recommended).
3. Attach the Profiler.cs script to the object as a component.
